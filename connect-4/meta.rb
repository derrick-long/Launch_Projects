#okay so we need to puts a gameboard
#need player names associated with their marker and they need to be unique
#need to identify a win condition
class ideas
- board (physical state of the gameboard,where peices are etc.)
- player (stores both player name and their marker
  -name must be unique
  -must prompt player for name
- game (the rules etc of connect 4, put winners here and maybe creation of subsequent classes ie players and the board?)
