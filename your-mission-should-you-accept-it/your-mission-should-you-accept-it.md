First of all, congratulations on your progress! Give yourself a pat on the back. You've learned a ton about Rails routes, form helpers, client-side and server-side validations, and using Active Record to make associations in your database.

And, believe it or not, you're now ready to build a fully-featured Rails application!

### Learning Goals

* Prepare and understand what to expect from the Rescue Mission challenge
* Identify handy reference materials

### What to Expect  

You are being asked to build an application with multiple features that allow your user to create, update, edit, delete, and view questions and answers a la Stack Overflow. Full user stories are in the challenge itself.

In case it's not fully obvious, this is a _large_ challenge. We expect it to take you multiple days. Be patient with yourself, get excited, and make the most of this process.

Our suggestions:

* Ask lots of questions.
* Read, and re-read, the reference materials we've provided in this phase, as well as the external references below.
* Make good use of your 1-on-1 time with your mentor. It may even be useful to jot down questions as you work through the Rescue Mission challenge to bring to your 1-on-1 sessions!
