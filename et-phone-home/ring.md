7) You're stuck in an elevator with a famous person of any discipline, currently living or long deceased. Who would you get stuck in an elevator with, and what would you talk about?

It's kind of a boring answer, but I think Moebius would be cool to talk to. He was a french comic book artist. He was really ahead of his time in many ways and he drew pretty pictures. Hopefully we'd talk about cats and what his favorite food is. If I were particularly lucky, I'd ask him how he got the world to agree to call him Moebius. Such a sick a pen name, like, for realsies.
